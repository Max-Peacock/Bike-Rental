# Bike-Rental

## Project Summary
Using Jupyter, pandas and pgAdmin4 to combine, clean and analyse Bike Rental and weather correlations.

### Data Collection and Processing
The project involved collating data from 12 monthly bike rental reports and a yearly weather spreadsheet. Data collation, cleaning, and tidying were performed using Jupyter Notebooks, Python, and the Pandas library.

### Database Management
The cleaned and organized data was then inserted into a PostgreSQL database (pgAdmin4). Views were created within pgAdmin4 to facilitate easier querying and analysis of the data.

### Data Analysis
After processing the data, Jupyter Notebooks were used to summarize the findings and insights obtained from the datasets.
